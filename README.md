# WorkManager
# Simple project to demonstrate the usage of workmanager.
# 2 work requests are performed. At first, app will try to download the image from api using workmanager & once the image is downloaded, another workmanger request is 
# used to apply filter on it.
# App will download the image in internal storage even if the app is killed
